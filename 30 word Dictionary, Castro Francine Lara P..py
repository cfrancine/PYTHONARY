    "E-CORE" : "E-core is a laminated configuration resembling the capital letter E in some transformers and inductive transducers",
    "FADING" : " In wireless communiction, fading is deviation of the attenuation affecting a signal over certain propagation media",
    "GAIN" : " Gain is the capacity of a circuit to increase the strength of the input signal.The gain is measured by the ratio of the magnitude of the output signal to that of the input signal",
    "HARDWARE" : "A hardware is any physical component or assembled system that is meant to performed certain function in contrast to the software loaded",
    "IDETITY LAW" : "Whereas elementary algebra applies to numbers Boolean algebra is about truth values true and false , or 1 and 0, and the resuts obtained by acting on them with AND,OR and NOT operators. Every digital computer uses Boolean algebra; all calculations are based on processing arrays of 1s and 0s.",
    "JUNCTION" : " Junction in which two materials featuring distinctly different electrical properties are in contact",
    "KERNAL" : "Kernal is a program that constitutes the central core of a computer OS",

    "QUANTIZE" : "The process of sub dividing a continuous signal to discrete values",
    "RADAR" : "A system that use synchronized radio transmitter and receiver to out pulse radio waves that can detect the presence, distance and activities of any distant objects like a space craft",
    "SAMPLING" : "Aprocess in which the input signal is converted into number of discrete electrical values either to store, process and/or display by an oscilloscope",
